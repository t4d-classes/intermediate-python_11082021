# Unit Testing - Exercise 1

## Requirements

Note: Please read all requirements before proceeding.

1. Under the `tests` folder, create a folder named `rates_app`. Add an empty `__init__.py` file to the new folder.

2. Create a new file named `test_client_commands.py`.

3. Write two unit tests in the `test_client_commands.py` file. One test for a successful parsing of a command, and one test for an unsuccessful parsing of a command.

4. Using your editor, run the tests. Ensure they both pass.
